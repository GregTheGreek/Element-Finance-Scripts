### Existing Contracts
A few contracts need to be deployed in advance (could be bundled into the same script, but simplicity wise they're seperated):
- SushiSwap MasterChef rewards contracts
    - Used for *new* pools to allow users to claim rewards.
- Airdrop rewards contract
    - Used to reward *past* terms that fell within the 6 month window.
